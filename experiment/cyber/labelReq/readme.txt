Files labelled "runCyberSelectionP" and "runSelPMult" are using the two-stage pseudo-count 
classifier to evaluate each time a new labelled is received.

Both use the cyber dataset.

"runSelPMult" differs because it allows the same label to be selected multiple times.

To graph these, run each script separately and look at the LAM object that each one produces.
